The code in this folder is the one that was used in the original version, before
the paper was reviewed and accepted. The merged data was produced using SMOS
instead of ASCAT, and there were errors in the triple collocation method. The
gap-filling was done as a post-processing step, whereas now, the gapfilling is
done within the merging code. The subforder "3_gap_filling" contains the code
originally used for gapfilling (Maliko Tanguy - 21/07/2021)
