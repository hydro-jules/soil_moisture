# Soil Moisture code for HydroJULES merged product
This repository contains all the code and instructions needed to produce the merged soil moisture dataset described in Peng et al. (2021), using triple collocation merging technique. The output gridded soil moisture product, available to download from the EIDC (Tanguy et al., 2021), is the result of merging two remote sensing satellite soil moisture products (SMAP and ASCAT) and soil moisture from a land surface model (JULES-CHESS). The triple collocation method ensures that the error in the merged product is minimised from a statistical point of view (minimises random errors).
The step-by-step instructions can be found in the “documentation” subfolder.
